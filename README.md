### Making Styling Changes

This project uses SASS/SCSS syntax for styling.

1. Make all styling changes inside of `assets/main.scss` - do not edit `assets/main.css` directly.
2. To see/save your changes, install SASS for the command line: `npm i -g sass`
3. Run the SASS compile command from the project root: `sass assets/main.scss assets/main.css`
4. Confirm your changes on the client and in `assets/main.css`
5. Commit all of the following files: `assets/main.scss`, `assets/main.css` and `assets/main.css.map`
